          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Future Foundry was born from a simple observation: too many talented individuals 
            struggle to find their ideal career path due to lack of personalized guidance and 
            access to industry experts. We combine cutting-edge AI technology with human wisdom 
            to solve this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our platform uses machine learning algorithms trained on thousands of successful 
            career transitions to provide accurate predictions and recommendations. But we don't 
            stop at algorithms â€“ we believe in the power of human connection and mentorship.
